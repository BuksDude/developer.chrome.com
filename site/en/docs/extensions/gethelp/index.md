We do our best to improve and expand the content on this site. Some of you might run into problems we don't cover. Fortunately, there are other ways for you to get help.

- Many members of the Chrome extensions team monitor and participate in the [Chromium extensions](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chromium-extensions) Google Group.
- StackOverflow has a few tags you should follow and search. The [google-chrome-extension](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/google-chrome-extension) tag covers Chrome extensions generally. There's also a [chrome-extension-manifest-v](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/chrome-extension-manifest-v3) tag.
